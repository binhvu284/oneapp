# AI Data Directory

This directory contains description files and data that help the AI assistant understand:
- User requirements and rules
- User behavior patterns
- User preferences and working style
- AI assistant configuration and capabilities

## Purpose

These files serve as a knowledge base for:
1. **AI Assistant Module**: To understand user preferences and provide personalized assistance
2. **Future Development**: For other AI agents or developers to continue the project
3. **Project Continuity**: Ensuring consistent behavior and understanding across development sessions

## File Structure

- `requirements.md`: Core requirements and rules for the AI assistant
- `behavior.md`: User behavior patterns and preferences
- `preferences.md`: User preferences for UI, features, and interactions
- `capabilities.md`: AI assistant capabilities and limitations

## Usage

When working with the AI assistant module, these files should be:
1. Loaded at startup
2. Referenced for decision-making
3. Updated as user preferences evolve
4. Used to train or configure the AI assistant's behavior

## Note

These files are critical for maintaining project continuity. Keep them updated and well-documented.
